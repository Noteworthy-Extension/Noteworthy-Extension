## About The Project

![Logo](dist/assets/images/Noteworthy-Logo.png)

Noteworthy is a browser based extension that allows you to make annotations and take notes on any website. It has many features from text to drawing that all work on any website. With local storage, the notes you take are saved locally to your device so that the notes load when you visit the site again. 

Why to use Noteworthy:

* Taking notes on the website itself is faster and easier meaning you will likely take more and better notes!

* Our note storage system is local to your device meaning that it never goes through an external database where the data could be collected.

* Putting notes on a page that you will visit again will lead to you actually looking back at your notes versus never opening that document that you might be taking notes on now!
