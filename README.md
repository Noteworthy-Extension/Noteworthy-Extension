<!-- ABOUT THE PROJECT -->
## About The Project

Noteworthy is a browser based extension that allows you to make annotations and take notes on any website. It has many features from text to drawing that all work on any website. With local storage, the notes you take are saved locally to your device so that the notes load when you visit the site again. 

### Features

Noteworthy has many features giving you as much freedom on the website as if it was a piece of paper. 

With Noteworthy you can annotate the page with:
* Drawing
* Highlighting
* Shapes
* Lines
* Arrows
* Textboxes

### Built With

We built our app with pure Typescript to ensure code security, then we transpile our code to JS. We also used pure Sass which allows more complex visual styling and makes it easier for the app to not conflict with the website. After compiling it to code that the browser can read, we bundled our code into one minified file with Gulp. This is the file that we use for the chrome extension.
